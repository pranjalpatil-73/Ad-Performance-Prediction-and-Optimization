# Ad-Performance-Prediction-and-Optimization

This project provides an end-to-end solution for predicting digital ad click performance and optimizing ad placement strategies using machine learning. By analyzing various user and ad attributes, the system aims to help advertisers maximize their campaign effectiveness and return on investment.

## Features

**Data Loading & Exploration:** Loads and performs initial exploration of ad clickstream data to understand its structure, data types, and identify missing values.

**Robust Data Preprocessing:** Imputes missing numerical age values with the median and fills missing categorical features (e.g., gender, device\_type, ad\_position, Browse\_history, time\_of\_day) with 'Unknown' to ensure data completeness. Irrelevant identifiers like `id` and `full_name` are removed for focused analysis.

**Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes distributions of key features like age, gender, device type, ad position, Browse history, and time of day. It also examines the click rates across these different attributes to uncover trends and insights into user engagement.

**Automated Feature Engineering:** Categorical features are automatically transformed into numerical formats using one-hot encoding, and numerical features are scaled using `StandardScaler` to prepare the data for machine learning models.

**Advanced Machine Learning Models:** Implements and evaluates multiple classification algorithms, including:

* **Logistic Regression:** A baseline model for binary classification.
* **Random Forest Classifier:** An ensemble learning method known for its robustness.
* **XGBoost Classifier:** A highly efficient and powerful gradient boosting framework.

**Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV:** Optimizes model performance by systematically searching for the best hyperparameters for the `RandomForestClassifier`, ensuring the model achieves its maximum predictive capability.

**Model Evaluation:** Provides detailed classification reports, confusion matrices, and ROC AUC scores for each trained model to assess their accuracy, precision, recall, and overall performance in predicting ad clicks.

**Ad Performance Prediction:** Offers a function to predict the likelihood of an ad click for a given user profile, providing probabilities for both click and no-click outcomes.

**Ad Placement Recommendation:** Recommends the optimal ad position (Top, Middle, Bottom) for a given user profile by evaluating the predicted click probabilities for each position.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of this project up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.7 or higher recommended).

### Installation

Clone the repository (if applicable):

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>
```

(Note: If this is a standalone notebook, you can just download the `.ipynb` file.)

Install the required Python packages. It's recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
```

### Download the Dataset

The notebook expects a dataset named `ad_click_dataset.csv` in the `/content/` directory. You will need to place your `ad_click_dataset.csv` file in the same directory as your Jupyter Notebook, or update the path in the notebook's code:

```python
df = pd.read_csv('ad_click_dataset.csv')
```

## Usage

### Open the Jupyter Notebook

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and start Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook "Ad Performance Prediction and Optimization.ipynb"
```

This will open the notebook in your web browser.

### Run the Cells

Execute each cell sequentially within the notebook.

* The notebook will load the data, perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and then train and evaluate the machine learning models.
* It will display various visualizations and model performance metrics.

### Predict Ad Performance

You can use the `predict_ad_performance` function to get click probabilities for new user data:

```python
example_user = {
    'age': 30,
    'gender': 'Female',
    'device_type': 'Mobile',
    'ad_position': 'Top',
    'Browse_history': 'Shopping',
    'time_of_day': 'Evening'
}
prediction = predict_ad_performance(example_user)
print(prediction)
```

This will output the predicted click probabilities for the given user.

### Get Ad Placement Recommendations

Use the `recommend_ad_placement` function to find the best ad position:

```python
example_profile = {
    'age': 28,
    'gender': 'Male',
    'device_type': 'Desktop',
    'Browse_history': 'News',
    'time_of_day': 'Afternoon'
}
recommendation = recommend_ad_placement(example_profile)
print(recommendation)
```

This will provide a recommended ad position based on predicted click-through rates.


## Future Enhancements

* **Deployment:** Integrate the model into a web application or API for real-time predictions.
* **More Advanced Models:** Explore deep learning models or other cutting-edge algorithms for improved accuracy.
* **A/B Testing Integration:** Connect predictions to actual A/B testing frameworks for continuous optimization.
* **Interactive Dashboards:** Create interactive dashboards (e.g., using Dash or Streamlit) to visualize recommendations and model insights.
* **More Features:** Incorporate external data sources (e.g., economic indicators, seasonal trends) to enrich the dataset.
